Thanks for dropping by, I hope you like my dotfiles! :)

Here are some details about my setup:
- **OS:** Manjaro
- **WM:** i3-gaps
- **Bar:** Polybar 
- **Terminal:** Kitty
- **Shell**: ZSH 5.8

uwu is a custom theme done by me, based on Cloud theme, using unicode characters & kaomuji for japanese emoticons and inspired by machaerus's theme (Thank you, it's really beautiful your theme). Rofi's theme is from rofi-spotlight.
